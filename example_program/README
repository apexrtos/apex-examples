A simple demonstration of the capabilities of the build system.

The example program is mixed C/C++ and links against two libraries. lib1 is in
the top level source directory and lib2 is local to the example program.

The example program is included in the shell build, however, for development we
support building individual targets, for example, from a clean state:

make example_program/lib2/lib2.a	# will build just lib2.a
make example_program/example_program	# will build lib1.a and example_program
make lib1/lib1.a			# will do nothing as lib1.a is up to date
